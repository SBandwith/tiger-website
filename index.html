<h2>About Tigers</h2>
  <p>Standing at a height of 3.6 feet and being 11 ft long, these apex predators do more than proudly stand. They are incredibly intelligent, and strong, delivering a rapid, deadly bite to their prey. Tigers are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of their food chain. Their diet typically includes eating wild pigs and deer of various species, but they can even eat water buffalo, gaur, banteng, and Asian elephants and rhinoceros. They come in a variety of colors, including their signature red-orange coat with black stripes, but also they can have a white coat with black or brown stripes or pale-golden fur and reddish-brown stripes. A part of the Panthera genus: lions, panthers, and other big cats are a part of the same genetic family.</p>
